                        Put shortly - I'm a graphic designer who's learning to code.
                    <p>
                    <p>
                        If I took you to the beginning, I'd also tell you about my BA in English Literature and the years I worked as a translator from English into Spanish, but let's focus on my current career.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        It was February 2019 when I started a degree in <b>Digital Design</b>. This had been my life-long interest and I felt so eager to start in this world that I immediately started applying for design jobs. Just a few months later, I was hired at a small studio/workshop, where I got to become a <i>design octopus</i>: print, branding, illustrationâ€¦ If it could be designed, we'd say yes.
                    </p> 
                    <p>  
                        With this awesome experience under my belt, I moved to Germany in October 2020 and started my freelance journey. It was shortly after that I volunteered to build a website for a friend whose online presence was growing. I used Wordpress with Elementor to design and build the website, and loved the process so much that I started offering it as a service. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is where I admit that I am not <i>necessarily</i> an artsy person, but I am creative and feel the need to build things from scratch. And at the root of all, <b>I am an avid learner and a systematic problem solver</b>. It was only natural then that I'd get into developing my own websites! 
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        I am currently enrolled in CareerFoundry's Web Development bootcamp and plan to graduate in November 2023 as a <b>full-stack web developer</b>. I'm here to become your web fairy and make all your web wishes come true. &#x1F9DA

                            I'm originally from Valencia, Spain, but live in the fantastic city of Leipzig in Germany.

                            I'm fluent in Spanish, Catalan and English. I'm not quite there with German yet, but I'm pretty good at complaining about the language.
